I am a PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. I am working under the supervision of Prof. Borgonovo in the area of explainable AI. In particular, my research mainly focus on deploying methods from Sensitivity Analysis to shed light into Black-box models in Machine Learning.
Previously, I completed my Bachelor degree in Economics and Management at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany. Followed by a double degree master program in Economics & Finance at University of Hohenheim and University of Pavia in Italy. After the graduation, I started working as Data Scientist at the SteeringLab of Horv√°th & Partners, a German consulting company.
